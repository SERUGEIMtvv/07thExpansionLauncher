# 07thExpansionLauncher
A launcher for 07th Expansion When They Cry games (games not included)

How to use:
- download the latest release;
- unzip all fies to any place on the computer;
- open 07thExpansionLauncher.exe.config and fill in the paths to your games' exe files (for Steam releases use "steam://rungameid/(yourgameid)" instead);
- - I recommend to use the link to Windows Notepad or something as harmless for the games you don't have.
- (optional) install the Honoka Antique Kaku font (included) for the best experience, since the interface was designed using this font;
- create a shortcut for the 07thExpansionLauncher.exe and put it wherever you want;
- Enjoy having just one shortcut instead of 20.
