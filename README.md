# Launcher no Naku Koro ni
A launcher for 07th Expansion's When They Cry games (games not included).

# How to use:
- download the latest release with desired language (the default one is in English);
- unzip all fies to any place on the computer;
- open the *.exe.config file and fill in the paths to your games' exe files, minding the quote marks in strings;
- - for Steam releases use "steam://rungameid/(yourgameid)" instead;
- create a shortcut for the *.exe and put it wherever you want;
- Enjoy having just one shortcut instead of 20ish for each game.

# TODO
- multi-language version;
- check Japanese text with someone who knows the language;
- translate the error messages with the same person.
